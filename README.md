# Baby Feud ðŸŽ‰

A fun **Family Feudâ€“style game** customized for a baby shower / gender reveal party.  
This project lets you play the game on a TV for guests, while the host can control and reveal answers from their own device.

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- Questions and answers are preloaded into the app (`babyFeudData.js`).
- The game is shown on the **TV screen** in **normal mode** (questions visible, answers hidden).
- The **host device** (phone/laptop) can open the game in **host mode** to see the answers and reveal them at the right time.
- Both views stay in sync by using the same **random seed** in the URL.

---

## ðŸŽ® Game Modes

### Normal Mode (TV / Players)
Shows only the question and blank answer slots.  
ðŸ‘‰ URL format:
/baby-feud?seed=1234

Example:
http://localhost:5173/baby-feud?seed=1234

---

### Host Mode (Phone / Laptop)
Shows the same question order, but with answers visible to the host for reference.  
ðŸ‘‰ URL format:
/baby-feud?host=true&seed=1234

Example:
http://localhost:5173/baby-feud?host=true&seed=1234

---

## ðŸ”‘ Important Notes
- The `seed` value ensures both **TV** and **Host** see the questions in the same order.  
- Use **the same seed number** in both URLs (e.g., `1234`).  
- Refreshing will keep the order consistent.  
- Changing the seed creates a **new game order**.

---

## ðŸ†• Starting a New Game
1. Pick a new random seed (any number, e.g., `5678`).
2. Update both URLs with the new seed:
   - TV: `/baby-feud?seed=5678`
   - Host: `/baby-feud?host=true&seed=5678`

This way, you donâ€™t need to edit code to reset the questions.

---

## ðŸ›  Development
- Built with **React + React Router**.
- Data lives in `src/data/babyFeudData.js`.
- Shuffle order is controlled by a seeded shuffle function for consistent ordering across devices.

ðŸŽ‰ Have fun hosting your **Baby Feud** game!
